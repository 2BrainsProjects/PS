<br>

The **HTTP API documentation** for a frontend client application is available [here](docs\README.md).

The **backend technical document** containing the backend service implementation is available [here](code\jvm\README.md).

# How to run

install openssl version 3.3.0

To run the API, make sure you have Docker Desktop installed, and execute the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

To run the OnionRouter execute the following command:
```bash

```

The application only runs on localhost, but it receives the port as an argument in order to simulate communication between users.
This port must be different for each user and must be different from 8080
